# kaimitai's github-repositories

I like recreational programming and digital archaeology. Most of my public repos are editing tools for retrogames.

## DOS game editors

- [Sky High SkyRoads Editor](https://github.com/kaimitai/skyhigh_releases): A level and graphics editor for [SkyRoads](http://www.bluemoon.ee/history/skyroads/). My first level editor, inspired by a [video by Pixelmusement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH4JM5tLtDs). The challenge was to reverse engineer and implement a correct compression routine for the game data. The newest version of the editor renders the levels in a 3-D world, using OpenGL. The graphics editor is in a separate application. Once the code has been unified the source code will be made available.
- [Ken's Labyrinth Editor's Toolkit](https://github.com/kaimitai/klabkit-sdl): A complete modding tool for [Ken's Labyrinth](http://advsys.net/ken/klab.htm), the first commercial game by Ken Silverman who went on to create the Build engine. This is one of my childhood favorites, and for its 30 year anniversary I created this all-round editor supporting all versions of the game.
- [Superplexed](https://github.com/kaimitai/superplexed): A level and graphics editor for [Supaplex](https://www.supaplex.online/). Has undo/redo with history, animated gametiles and more.
- [Visual Titus](https://github.com/kaimitai/vtitus): A level and graphics editor for [Titus the Fox](http://ttf.mine.nu/) and Moktar. This is another game I played in my childhood, and what started out as a curious digging into the file formats turned into a full-fledged application. Source code will be made available once it is cleaned up.

## ROM editors

- [Solomon's Keychain](https://github.com/kaimitai/skchain): Solomon's Key (NES) ROM editor. Supports all official versions of the game, as well as a ROM expansion that vastly exceeds the original data size limits.

## Puzzles and Challenges 

- [TIS-100 solutions](https://github.com/kaimitai/TIS-100/): My solutions for the Zachtronics game [TIS-100](https://zachtronics.com/tis-100/). I completed all puzzles in the game within two weeks of purchasing it. Some of my solutions can trivially be improved upon, while I was pretty happy with others.
