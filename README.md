## Welcome to kaimitai's github repositories! 

I like recreational programming. Most of my public repos are editing tools for retrogames.

## ROM editors

## Puzzles and Challenges 

- [TIS-100 solutions](https://github.com/kaimitai/TIS-100/): My solutions for the Zachtronics game [TIS-100](https://zachtronics.com/tis-100/). I completed all puzzles in the game within two weeks of purchasing it. Some of my solutions can trivially be improved upon, while I was pretty happy with others.
